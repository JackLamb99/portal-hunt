You find yourself in The Glade.

Golden sunlight filters through a canopy of towering trees. The ground is a lush
carpet of moss, dotted with colourful wildflowers. A gentle breeze stirs the leaves,
mingling with the distant birdsong.

An ancient oak stands at the centre, with a message carved into the bark that reads:

	"A warning for the brave of heart,
	With wisdom only a few impart,
	Journey through these lands of old,
	Through caves deep and mountains cold,
	Where ancient dangers freely roam,
	You must seek the portals for passage home."
