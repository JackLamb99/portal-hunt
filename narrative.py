You find yourself in The Glade.

Golden sunlight filters through a canopy of towering trees. The ground is a

the leaves, mingling with the distant birdsong.

An ancient oak stands at the centre, its trunk knotted and twisted to resemble
a face, with deep-set eyes and a wise, weathered expression. As you approach,
the tree springs to life, its wide eyes locking onto you, branches rustling
softly as it speaks:

"A warning for the brave of heart,
With wisdom only a few impart,
Journey through these lands of old,

You return to The Glade, where your long and perilous adventure began.

The ancient oak stands at the centre, its trunk knotted and twisted in the
middle to resemble a face, with deep-set eyes and a wise, weathered expression.

face as it speaks:

"A thanks to you, a brave heart so true,
For the deeds only a hero could do,
You've journeyed through these lands of old,
Through caves deep and mountains cold,
Through scorching heat and forests drowned,
With relics returned and balance found,
You've banished the evil grip on this realm,
Now life can thrive, taking the helm."

into existence, glowing with a soft, inviting light. With a final nod from the
ancient oak, you step into the portal and are immediately surrounded by
swirling visions. You witness fires extinguishing, their destructive flames
vanishing into wisps of smoke. Floodwaters retreat, revealing rich soil
beneath. Vegetation springs to life, lush and green, while animals of all
kinds return to their habitats, filling the air with the sounds of a
rejuvenated world. The realm is healing, vibrant and full of life, as you are
