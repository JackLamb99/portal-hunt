"""

GLADE_TEXT = """
You find yourself in The Glade.

Golden sunlight filters through a canopy of towering trees. The ground is a \
lush carpet of moss, dotted with colourful wildflowers. A gentle breeze stirs \
the leaves, mingling with the distant birdsong.

An ancient oak stands at the centre, with a message carved into the bark that \
reads:

"A warning for the brave of heart,\

With wisdom only a few impart, \

Journey through these lands of old, \

Through caves deep and mountains cold, \

Where ancient dangers freely roam, \

You must seek the portals for passage home."
"""

CROSSROAD_TEXT = """
You find yourself at an empty crossroad, it is eerily quiet and nothing of
importance seems to be nearby.
"""

FLEE_TEXT = """
You choose to flee from this enemy.
"""

MOUNTAINS_DESC_TEXT = """
You are at the entrance to The Mountains.

A breathtaking landscape of towering, snow-capped peaks that rise dramatically
into the sky. Jagged ridges and sheer cliffs dominate the terrain, with narrow,
winding paths carved into the rock, leading through constricted gorges and
over precipitous drops.

The air is crisp and thin, filled with the echo of distant avalanches and the
whisper of the wind. Amidst the rugged terrain, hardy wildlife and scattered
pine trees find a way to thrive, the landscape is both breathtakingly
beautiful and perilously unforgiving.
"""

GOBLINS_DESC_TEXT = """
You enter a dense thicket of snow-laden pines. The branches hang low, heavy
with frost, forming a canopy that dims the sunlight. Among the trees, you
notice small footprints leading off the main path, a hint of something lurking
nearby.

You spot a gang of Snow Goblins, small and sneaky creatures draped in ragged
furs, clutching crude weapons made of bone and ice. Their pale blue skin
merges with the snowy landscape, and their sharp, glinting teeth reveal the
malice with which they skulk through the shadows, waiting to strike.
"""

GOBLINS_DEFEAT_TEXT = """
You forge ahead, but the Snow Goblins close in quickly, emerging from the
dense thicket of snow-laden pines. They are small and quick, darting through
the snow around you with a sinister agility.

You swing your arms wildly in an attempt to fend them off, but they evade with
practiced ease, closing the gap with terrifying speed.

A heavy blow from a bone club sends you to the ground, the cold snow stinging
as you fall. The goblins swarm around you, their ragged furs the last thing
you see as everything fades to darkness.

You were not equipped to defeat the Snow Goblins.
"""

GOBLINS_VICTORY_TEXT = """
You grasp the Frostfire, its blue flame casting an intense light through the
dense thicket, and charge at the Snow Goblins. They recoil at the heat, their
icy camouflage failing against the fierce glow.

As they try to surround you, you swing the torch in sweeping arcs, leaving
trails of searing heat. The goblins shriek as the fire burns through their
ragged furs and icy weapons.

With each swing, you drive them back, their snowy lair melting into slush. The
goblins flee, their ambush thwarted by the intense power of the Frostfire.

You are now free to travel through this area in peace.
"""

GOBLINS_CLEARED_TEXT = """
You have already defeated this enemy.

You calmly stride back through the dense thicket of snow-laden pines, the once-
menacing atmosphere feels noticeably lighter. The low-hanging branches, still
heavy with frost, part easily around you.

The ground is strewn with the remnants of the Snow Goblins' ambush, charred
remains of their crude weapons and tattered furs slowly melting into the snow.
The thicket, no longer haunted by their presence, seems quieter, as if nature
itself is sighing with relief. The path is clear, the threat gone, allowing
you to move forward with a sense of accomplishment.
