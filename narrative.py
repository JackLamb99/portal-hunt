"""Glade scene text, central starting point of the game"""
GLADE_TEXT = """
You find yourself in The Glade.

Golden sunlight filters through a canopy of towering trees. The ground is a \
lush carpet of moss, dotted with colourful wildflowers. A gentle breeze stirs \
the leaves, mingling with the distant birdsong.

An ancient oak stands at the centre, with a message carved into the bark that \
reads:

"A warning for the brave of heart,\

With wisdom only a few impart, \

Journey through these lands of old, \

Through caves deep and mountains cold, \

Where ancient dangers freely roam, \

You must seek the portals for passage home."
