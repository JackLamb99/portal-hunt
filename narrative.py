GLADE_TEXT = """
You find yourself in The Glade.

Golden sunlight filters through a canopy of towering trees. The ground is a \
lush carpet of moss, dotted with colourful wildflowers. A gentle breeze stirs \
the leaves, mingling with the distant birdsong.

An ancient oak stands at the centre, with a message carved into the bark that \
reads:

"A warning for the brave of heart,\

With wisdom only a few impart, \

Journey through these lands of old, \

Through caves deep and mountains cold, \

Where ancient dangers freely roam, \

You must seek the portals for passage home."
"""

MOUNTAINS_DESC_TEXT = """
You are at the entrance to The Mountains.

A breathtaking landscape of towering, snow-capped peaks that rise dramatically
into the sky. Jagged ridges and sheer cliffs dominate the terrain, with narrow,
winding paths carved into the rock, leading through constricted gorges and
over precipitous drops.

The air is crisp and thin, filled with the echo of distant avalanches and the
whisper of the wind. Amidst the rugged terrain, hardy wildlife and scattered
pine trees find a way to thrive, the landscape is both breathtakingly
beautiful and perilously unforgiving.
